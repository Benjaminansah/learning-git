According to one review, most cases of zinc deficiency are easily corrected with supplements and dietary modifications, leading to a rapid improvement of any symptoms caused by deficiency (6Trusted Source).

For example, diarrhea may improve within just 24 hours, whereas skin lesions typically heal within 1–2 weeks after people start taking the supplements (6Trusted Source).

If you’re getting enough zinc in your diet, supplements may not be necessary. If you suspect that you may have a deficiency, a doctor can test your blood levels to determine if a supplement could be beneficial.
